I originally made this program in my second programming class when we were learning about 
objects. I got very tired of copy-pasting code over and over, and then having to go back 
and make small changes line-by-line. The first iteration of this program used arrays that 
were 1000x1000, but now that I have take data-structures, I updated this program to take 
advantage of stacks, so it would be much more dynamic. Future iterations may add in 
functionality for nodes and different types of data structures like stacks.
